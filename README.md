# Dynamic News App

## Overview
The **Dynamic News App** is a web-based application that allows users to browse and search for the latest news articles. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app utilizes the News API to fetch and display news content dynamically based on user queries. The app features a responsive design, making it accessible and easy to use across various devices.

## Features
- **Real-Time News Fetching**: The app integrates with the News API to fetch the most recent news articles from a wide range of sources, ensuring users stay up-to-date with the latest information.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for news articles by keywords or topics, with results dynamically displayed on the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is crafted using CSS and Flexbox layout, ensuring optimal viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Content Update**: JavaScript functions are used to update the news content in real-time based on user interactions, such as searching or filtering by topics.
- **Semantic HTML**: The app is structured using semantic HTML elements, enhancing accessibility and SEO.

## Project Structure
- **HTML Files**: The main structure of the app is contained in the `index.html` file, organized with semantic elements for better readability and accessibility.
- **CSS Files**: Styling and layout are managed through `styles.css`, utilizing Flexbox to create a responsive design.
- **JavaScript Files**: All dynamic functionalities, including fetching news data and handling user interactions, are implemented in `script.js`.

## How It Works
1. **Browse News**: Upon loading, the app fetches and displays the latest news articles from various sources.
2. **Search News**: Users can enter keywords or phrases in the search bar to filter news articles relevant to their interests.
3. **View Articles**: Articles are displayed with a title, brief description, and a link to the full story. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a seamless experience across devices.
